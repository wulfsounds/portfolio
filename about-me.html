                <p>Web Developer, graphic designer, and musician creating dynamic web applications. Currently attending SMU to develop skills in MERN with newly acquired knowledge of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript through the Odin Project. My goal is to create unique web applications that represent creatives’ and/or companies’ personality and vision. Additionally, I have been commissioned by musicians, podcasters, comedians, houses of worship, and small businesses throughout Texas for graphic design. I’m excited to take the next step in programming that will offer a world of new opportunities in creative web design.</p>
